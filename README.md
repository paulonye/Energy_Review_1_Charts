# The Energy Review

The Energy Review is a bi-annual magazine for students that informs readers on the recent events in the energy industry.
The Energy review encompasses 3 different skill-sets ranging from writing, graphic designing, and data analytics. We focused on the creation of the charts since we are prime believers of story-telling with data, hence 66 charts were created so that our readers can understand easily.

All charts used in this project were created from scratch using data from `BP Statistical Review 2020`.

For this project, `excel and python programming language` were used in the cleaning up of the data, while `python` was used in the creation of all charts used in the magazine.

To understand how the charts correlate with real world information, check out the Energy Review pdf file.
